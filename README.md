# Module 12 Report

## Overview of the Analysis

* The purpose of this machine learning analysis is to build a model that can predict and identify the creditworthiness of future borrowers based on the known creditworthiness and information of past borrowers.
* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
The financial information provided by the dataset includes the following about the borrower and the loan:
  * Loan size: Size of the loan.
  * Interest rate: Interest rate of the loan.
  * Borrower Income: Income of the borrower.
  * Debt-to-Income: Ratio of how much the borrower owe vs the borrower's income.
  * Number of accounts: Number of loan and credit accounts
  * Derogatory marks: Indicates borrower's failure to pay an outstanding debt.
  * Total debt: Total debt owed by the borrower.
  * Loan Status: Indicates of the loan is a healthy one or a risky one.


* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any resampling method).

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
